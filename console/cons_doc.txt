Welcome to the Prolog Sentiment Analyzer.
By selecting option 1 in the menu, it will run the procedure for analyzing a text.
By selecting that option it will be asked to enter the input sentence to be analyzed. A correct input is composed by one or more words separated by space.
No signs and other special characters are allowed. Also remeber to type words in non plural form, in lowercase and verbs possibly in the root form. This is 
a simple sentiment analyzer, based on a dictionary extracted from "SentiWordNet v3.0.0", so consider that a limited amount of words can be accepted.
Once the input is entered it will proceed with a pipeline of operations, that will return a final outcome.
It will be displayed both the pipeline and the final result.


Some example of good input:

- i like to eat apple

- he is a very bad person

- the reason of his good behaviour is that he is a good person

Some examples of bad input:

- i like to play abcdef

- we are  not happy today

- me and you, love to watch a movie

By selecting option 3, the program will end.
