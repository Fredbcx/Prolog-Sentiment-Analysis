Welcome to the Prolog Sentiment Analyzer.
In order to run the procedure for analyzing a text, it necessary to first insert an input inside the input field.
Once an input is entered, it is necessary to press the "submit" button, that will run the procedure.
If the input is accepted, it will be displayed a modal containing the output of the operation, composed by the pipeline of operations and the final outcome,
A correct input is composed by one or more words separated by space. No signs and other special characters are allowed.
Also remeber to type words in non plural form, in lowercase and verbs possibly in the root form. This is a simple sentiment analyzer, based on
 a dictionary extracted from "SentiWordNet v3.0.0", so consider that a limited amount of words can be accepted.


Some example of good input:

- i like to eat apple

- he is a very bad person

- the reason of his good behaviour is that he is a good person

Some examples of bad input:

- i like to play abcdef

- we are  not happy today
